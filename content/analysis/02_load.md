Analysis
=======================
<p></p>

The task involved selecting three websites and testing their loading times, as well as assessing whether there were any aspects that could be improved in terms of loading speed and usability. 

Selection
-----------------------
<p></p>
I've selected same websites as previous assignment:

<li><a href="https://caiacosmetics.se/">https://caiacosmetics.se/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.prettylittlething.com/">https://www.prettylittlething.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cube.asia/">https://cube.asia/</a></li>

<p></p>
Method
-----------------------
<p></p>

As a measurement tool, I used PageSpeed Insights and saved the data into a Google Spreadsheet, which I then presented here on the page.

Analys
-----------------------

caiacosmetics.se loads quickly on both laptops and mobile devices, providing a positive user experience. The speed index and FCP values show fast loading times, and the overall page speed and size are acceptable.
<p></p>
prettylittlething.com, on the other hand, lags in performance. Higher speed index and FCP values suggest slower loading, especially on mobile devices. The numerous resources contribute to an extended overall page speed and a heavier page size, indicating potential room for improvement.
<p></p>
cube.asia excels in performance, scoring exceptionally well on both laptops and mobile devices. Low speed index and FCP values indicate a very fast loading time. Despite having more resources, the overall page speed and size remain optimized, ensuring a positive user experience.
<p></p>
In summary, caiacosmetics.se and cube.asia demonstrate strong performance, while prettylittlething.com could enhance its performance by optimizing resources to improve loading times and user experience.


<h3>Website Improvement Suggestions</h3>

caiacosmetics.se: Although caiacosmetics.se is doing well, it can do even better by making resources more efficient. This will make the page load faster and be more user-friendly.

prettylittlething.com: To make the user experience better, prettylittlething.com should make its resources work more efficiently. This means reducing the number of resources to make the site load faster, especially on mobile devices.

cube.asia: cube.asia is doing great, but there's a chance to make things even smoother. By optimizing resources, the site can stay fast and impressive without using too many resources.

<h3>Ranking and Winner</h3>

<ol><h4> 1. Cube Asia</h4> With consistently high scores across all metrics, cube.asia is therefore the winner, demonstrating exceptional performance in terms of loading speed, resource efficiency, and overall user experience.</ol>
<p></p>
<ol> <h4> 2. Caia Cosmetics</h4> Positioned in the middle, caiacosmetics.se performs well but has the potential for further optimization in terms of resource efficiency.</ol> 
<p></p>
<ol> <h4>3. PrettyLittleThing</h4> Lagging behind in performance metrics, prettylittlething.com would benefit from substantial improvements, particularly in optimizing resources for faster loading times.</ol>
