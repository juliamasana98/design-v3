Analysis
=======================
<p></p>

The task involved selecting three websites and testing their loading times, as well as assessing whether there were any aspects that could be improved in terms of loading speed and usability. 

Selection
-----------------------
<p></p>
I've selected same websites as previous assignment:

<li><a href="https://caiacosmetics.se/">https://caiacosmetics.se/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.prettylittlething.com/">https://www.prettylittlething.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cube.asia/">https://cube.asia/</a></li>

<p></p>
Method
-----------------------
<p></p>

As a measurement tool, I utilized PageSpeed Insights, as it comes highly recommended. I subsequently saved the data into a Google Spreadsheet, which I then presented here on the page.

Analys
-----------------------

caiacosmetics.se demonstrates good performance on both laptop and mobile devices. The speed index and FCP values indicate a fast loading time, with a moderate amount of resources. The overall page speed and size are acceptable, contributing to a positive user experience.
<p></p>
prettylittlething.com lags behind in performance, with higher speed index and FCP values indicating a slower loading time, especially on mobile devices. The large number of resources contributes to a longer overall page speed and a heavier page size, suggesting potential room for optimization.
<p></p>
cube.asia excels in performance with excellent scores on both laptop and mobile. The low speed index and FCP values indicate a very fast loading time. While the number of resources is higher, the overall page speed and size are still well-optimized, contributing to a positive user experience.
<p></p>
In summary, caiacosmetics.se and cube.asia perform well in terms of performance metrics, while prettylittlething.com could benefit from optimization, especially in terms of reducing resources to improve loading times and user experience.


<h3>Website Improvement Suggestions</h3>
